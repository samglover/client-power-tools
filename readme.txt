#### Automatic

Automatic installation is the easiest option. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard and go to **Plugins** / **Add New**. Enter “Client Power Tools" in the search field. To install Client Power Tools, click the **Install Now** button, then activate it by clicking the **Activate** button.

I recommend enabling automatic updates for Client Power Tools. To enable automatic updates, log into your WordPress dashboard and go to **Plugins** / **Installed Plugins**. Look for Client Power Tools and click **Enable auto-updates** in the **Automatic Updates** column.
