# Changelog for Client Power Tools

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

### 1.8.6 - 2024-08-25

#### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in cpt_messages() where calling get_the_ID() after cpt_messages() would return the last message ID instead of the main post ID.
- Fixed a bug in cpt_get_notices() where WordPress would add a second, unstyled dismiss button to notices on the frontend.


### 1.8.5 - 2024-06-09

#### Changed
- Admin styles and scripts are now loaded only on CPT admin pages.
- Removed cpt_redirect_clients() function from /admin/cpt-admin.php because it wasn't actually doing anything.

#### Fixed
- The guard statements in the cpt_admin_actions() function in /admin/cpt-admin.php were over-inclusive and allowing some processes through only to cause them to fail. See [issue #40](https://github.com/samglover/client-power-tools/issues/40) for an example where WP All Import uploads were failing. This is now fixed.


### 1.8.4 - 2024-01-23

#### Changed
- Name updated to Client Power Tools Portal since there is also a Client Power Tools theme and several helper plugins.
- Split up /assets/js/cpt-frontend.js into /assets/js/cpt-login-modal.js and /assets/js/cpt-notices.js.
- Simplified the login modal and notices functionality and styling. The CSS styling has been simplified with the idea that it should be relatively easy to customize. (Here is how I customize Client Power Tools for my own theme: https://github.com/samglover/cpt-theme/blob/main/assets/scss/_customize-cpt.scss. Each SCSS variable pulls in a corresponding CSS variable from theme.json that applies my styles for things like borders and shadows so that Client Power Tools looks as much a part of the theme as possible.)
- The client dashboard nav menu now uses the same classes as regular WordPress menus, so it should inherit styling and dropdown behavior, as well. This drastically reduces the amount of styling added by this plugin.
- Enabling breadcrumb navigation now applies to additional pages as well as the knowledge base.

### Fixed
- Fixed error when sending messages from the front end.
- Fixed login modal animation.

### Removed
- Removed the /frontend/images folder and its contents, which were not used anywhere.


### 1.8.3 - 2024-01-11

#### Changed
- Added .wp-element-button to all buttons for better theme.json compatibility.


### 1.8.2 - 2024-01-08

#### Changed
- Client manager and custom fields are wider.
- Disabled project type taxonomy archive pages.
- Disabled autocomplete on the new- and edit-client forms.


### 1.8.1 - 2023-10-13

#### Fixed
- Get client name for the admin client list table.
- Don't show recipients if they weren't stored when sending the message.


### 1.8 - 2023-10-13

#### Added
- Separate client name and primary contact name.
- Add additional contacts to be CCed on messages.


### 1.7.8 - 2023-08-08

#### Fixed
- The login form would sometimes fail under unusual conditions. Now it should happily log you in as expected, or else deliver error messages instead of just sitting there opaquely.


### 1.7.7 - 2023-08-03

#### Changed
- Renamed the primary dashboard page in the navigation tabs to "Home.'
- Moved the page title filter from /common/cpt-common.php to /frontend/cpt-frontend.php.

#### Fixed
- The home page title would show as "Client Dashboard: Client Dashboard" which was dumb. Fixed.


### 1.7.6 - 2023-07-27

#### Added
- cpt_is_additional_page()
- cpt_add_nav_to_addl_pages()

#### Changed
- No longer shows projects in the client list table if the Projects module is not active.
- Consolidated Knowledge Base breadcrumbs logic in the cpt_breadcrumbs function.
- Clarified cpt_is_knowledge_base() logic.
- cpt_is_client_dashboard() now functions more intuitively. If no arguments are given, it returns true if any dashboard page is being shown. Arguments may also be given in the form of an array.
- Page titles within the client dashboard now include both the dashboard title and the name of the page for all pages.

#### Deprecated
- Deprecated the confusingly named cpt_is_cpt() function from /frontend/frontend.php. cpt_is_client_dashboard() does the same job. (cpt_is_cpt() still works; it just returns the output of cpt_is_client_dashboard()).


### 1.7.5 - 2023-07-24

#### Added
- cpt_is_client_dashboard('additional page') now returns true on additional pages and their descendants.


### 1.7.4 - 2023-05-22

#### Changed
- Capitalize project labels just in case the user doesn't.

#### Removed
- Somehow a number of files had gotten duplicated in the wrong directories. They're gone now.

#### Fixed
- The navigation tabs now fold up nicely at narrow widths.


### 1.5 - 2022-11-03

- The frontend login form now uses AJAX rather than reloading the page with each submission.
- Adjusted login modal max width.
- Move the new and edit client forms to their own files, /admin/cpt-new-client-form.php and /admin/cpt-edit-client-form.php.

### 1.4.7 - 2022-01-12

### 1.4 - 2021-01-12

#### Added
- NEW MODULE: Knowledge Base! The knowledge base is a restricted page you can use to share information and resources with your clients. Add as many sub-pages as you like; they will be nicely organized in an index for your clients.
- Client dashboard pages now have navigation tabs, including breadcrumbs and a drop-down index to help clients navigate your knowledge base.

#### Changed

- New client emails will now come from the client manager instead of a default name and email address.
- Update the element expander script so it can handle multiple expanders on the same page. Also, form elements within an expander with data-required="true" will have the required attributes removed when hidden.
- Make cpt_get_notices() easier to use by changing the argument to an array so it only needs to be called once.

#### Fixed
- The standard login form no longer redirects to a blank page when a redirect is present.
