# Changelog for Client Power Tools

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) and uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).


### 1.10.0 - 2024-10-28

#### Added
- Default styles for the navigation menu. These should be overidden by themes that include styles for regular WordPress menus, and have low specificity so they are easy to override with custom CSS. (The default styles are not applied to the [Client Power Tools theme](https://github.com/samglover/cpt-theme).)


### 1.9.3 - 2024-10-27

#### Changed
- Reorganized and streamlined some code.

#### Fixed
- Fixed duplicate dashboard output and message output.


### 1.9.2 - 2024-10-27

#### Added
- \[client-dashboard] shortcode allows the dashboard to be placed manually on the dashboard page.

#### Changed
- Abstracted several dashboard functions to make the code easier to follow and to make it easier to implement the new shortcode.

#### Fixed
- Content added to the dashboard page in the WordPress editor no longer shows up on the Messages and Projects pages/tabs.
- Enforced strict type comparison and Yoda condition checks for the cpt_is_client_dashboard() and related functions.


### 1.9.1 - 2024-10-25

#### Changed
- References to WP_User_Query now use the correct case (WP_User_Query instead of WP_USER_QUERY).

#### Fixed
- Fixed potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.


### 1.9.0 - 2024-10-24

#### Added
- Installed Composer in order to use WordPress Coding Standards formatting aids.
- Added notes for translators.

#### Changed
- Include WP_List_Table from core instead of including the file.
- Reformatted PHP according to the WordPress Coding Standards.
- Switch the SVG logo used in the admin for a PNG to fix a Plugin Check alert.

#### Removed
- /includes
- /includes/class/wp-list-table.php

#### Fixed
- Added escape functions for all output to resolve Plugin Check alerts. In many cases this resulted in minor changes to the output, some of which would impact existing translations. As a result this release merits a minor version increment to 1.9.0, but since there are no actual translations (that I am aware of, at least) I don't think it will impact any existing users.


### 1.8.6 - 2024-08-25

#### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in cpt_messages() where calling get_the_ID() after cpt_messages() would return the last message ID instead of the main post ID.
- Fixed a bug in cpt_get_notices() where WordPress would add a second, unstyled dismiss button to notices on the frontend.


### 1.8.5 - 2024-06-09

#### Changed
- Admin styles and scripts are now loaded only on CPT admin pages.
- Removed cpt_redirect_clients() function from /admin/cpt-admin.php because it wasn't actually doing anything.

#### Fixed
- The guard statements in the cpt_admin_actions() function in /admin/cpt-admin.php were over-inclusive and allowing some processes through only to cause them to fail. See [issue #40](https://github.com/samglover/client-power-tools/issues/40) for an example where WP All Import uploads were failing. This is now fixed.


### 1.8.4 - 2024-01-23

#### Changed
- Name updated to Client Power Tools Portal since there is also a Client Power Tools theme and several helper plugins.
- Split up /assets/js/cpt-frontend.js into /assets/js/cpt-login-modal.js and /assets/js/cpt-notices.js.
- Simplified the login modal and notices functionality and styling. The CSS styling has been simplified with the idea that it should be relatively easy to customize. (Here is how I customize Client Power Tools for my own theme: https://github.com/samglover/cpt-theme/blob/main/assets/scss/_customize-cpt.scss. Each SCSS variable pulls in a corresponding CSS variable from theme.json that applies my styles for things like borders and shadows so that Client Power Tools looks as much a part of the theme as possible.)
- The client dashboard nav menu now uses the same classes as regular WordPress menus, so it should inherit styling and dropdown behavior, as well. This drastically reduces the amount of styling added by this plugin.
- Enabling breadcrumb navigation now applies to additional pages as well as the knowledge base.

### Fixed
- Fixed error when sending messages from the front end.
- Fixed login modal animation.

### Removed
- Removed the /frontend/images folder and its contents, which were not used anywhere.


### 1.8.3 - 2024-01-11

#### Changed
- Added .wp-element-button to all buttons for better theme.json compatibility.


### 1.8.2 - 2024-01-08

#### Changed
- Client manager and custom fields are wider.
- Disabled project type taxonomy archive pages.
- Disabled autocomplete on the new- and edit-client forms.


### 1.8.1 - 2023-10-13

#### Fixed
- Get client name for the admin client list table.
- Don't show recipients if they weren't stored when sending the message.


### 1.8 - 2023-10-13

#### Added
- Separate client name and primary contact name.
- Add additional contacts to be CCed on messages.


### 1.7.8 - 2023-08-08

#### Fixed
- The login form would sometimes fail under unusual conditions. Now it should happily log you in as expected, or else deliver error messages instead of just sitting there opaquely.


### 1.7.7 - 2023-08-03

#### Changed
- Renamed the primary dashboard page in the navigation tabs to "Home.'
- Moved the page title filter from /common/cpt-common.php to /frontend/cpt-frontend.php.

#### Fixed
- The home page title would show as "Client Dashboard: Client Dashboard" which was dumb. Fixed.


### 1.7.6 - 2023-07-27

#### Added
- cpt_is_additional_page()
- cpt_add_nav_to_addl_pages()

#### Changed
- No longer shows projects in the client list table if the Projects module is not active.
- Consolidated Knowledge Base breadcrumbs logic in the cpt_breadcrumbs function.
- Clarified cpt_is_knowledge_base() logic.
- cpt_is_client_dashboard() now functions more intuitively. If no arguments are given, it returns true if any dashboard page is being shown. Arguments may also be given in the form of an array.
- Page titles within the client dashboard now include both the dashboard title and the name of the page for all pages.

#### Deprecated
- Deprecated the confusingly named cpt_is_cpt() function from /frontend/frontend.php. cpt_is_client_dashboard() does the same job. (cpt_is_cpt() still works; it just returns the output of cpt_is_client_dashboard()).


### 1.7.5 - 2023-07-24

#### Added
- cpt_is_client_dashboard('additional page') now returns true on additional pages and their descendants.


### 1.7.4 - 2023-05-22

#### Changed
- TinyMCE editor toolbar simplified.

#### Changed
- Added a "no projects found" message when a client does not have any projects.

#### Removed
- Removed custom fields from project forms.

#### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that was causing messages to be sent to the sender rather than the intended recipient, which is obviously not how it is supposed to work.


### 1.7.1 - 2023-05-08

#### Changed
- Defaults for new project-related settings.
- Updated readme.txt.


### 1.7 - 2023-05-08

- Removed the default client manager.
- Show an error if a page requests a nonexistent client.
- Lots of small user experience improvements and updates.
- All forms updated with an improved layout.

#### Fixed

- Fixed page titles not showing up on empty dashboard pages.
- Lots of smaller fixes in the course of adding the Projects & Stages module.

- Status update request button is now disabled with "Status Update Requested" instead of invisible when an update has been requested.
- Change knowledge base submenu drop-down animation.

#### Removed
- Somehow a number of files had gotten duplicated in the wrong directories. They're gone now.

#### Fixed
- The navigation tabs now fold up nicely at narrow widths.


### 1.5 - 2022-11-03

#### Added
- IMPORTANT: Passwordless login. The default frontend login process is now passwordless. Instead of entering a username and password, clients request a login code by email. (Username and password is still available.)

#### Changed
- Updated the new-client welcome message for passwordless login.
- The frontend login form now uses AJAX rather than reloading the page with each submission.
- Adjusted login modal max width.
- Move the new and edit client forms to their own files, /admin/cpt-new-client-form.php and /admin/cpt-edit-client-form.php.

### 1.4.7 - 2022-01-12

#### Added
- NEW MODULE: Knowledge Base! The knowledge base is a restricted page you can use to share information and resources with your clients. Add as many sub-pages as you like; they will be nicely organized in an index for your clients.
- Client dashboard pages now have navigation tabs, including breadcrumbs and a drop-down index to help clients navigate your knowledge base.

#### Changed

- New client emails will now come from the client manager instead of a default name and email address.
