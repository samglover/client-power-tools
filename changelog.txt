### 1.4 - 2021-01-12

#### Added
- NEW MODULE: Knowledge Base! The knowledge base is a restricted page you can use to share information and resources with your clients. Add as many sub-pages as you like; they will be nicely organized in an index for your clients.
- Client dashboard pages now have navigation tabs, including breadcrumbs and a drop-down index to help clients navigate your knowledge base.

#### Changed

- Each of the non-core modules can be disabled. Currently the non-core modules are the Status Update Request Button, Messaging, and Knowledge Base.
- You can now add content to the main client dashboard page, which will be shown below the welcome message and status update request button (if it is enabled).

### 1.3.1 - 2020-12-18

#### Added
- Welcome message.

#### Changed
- Only show the SSL warning on CPT admin pages.


### 1.3 - 2020-11-24

#### Added
- Client managers can now be added and removed from the new **Managers** submenu, and are also shown in the client list and client profile. As you can when adding a client, you can add a new or existing WordPress user.
- Assign a default client manager in the settings.
- Filter the client list by clients assigned to you ("Mine").

#### Changed
- The add-client form is now on the Clients page.
- Messages and status update requests now go to the client manager. (The email will be CC'd to the now-optional status update request notification email address, if you have set one.)
- New client emails will now come from the client manager instead of a default name and email address.
- Update the element expander script so it can handle multiple expanders on the same page. Also, form elements within an expander with data-required="true" will have the required attributes removed when hidden.
- Make cpt_get_notices() easier to use by changing the argument to an array so it only needs to be called once.
